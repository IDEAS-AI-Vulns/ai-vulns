## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within Mixeway Flow, please report it as soon as possible.

### How to Report

- **GitHub Issues:**  
  Create a new issue in the repository and apply the `vulnerability` label. Please provide as much detail as possible about the vulnerability, including the steps to reproduce it, the impact, and any potential fix or mitigation.

- **Discord:**  
  If you prefer a more private channel or immediate communication, you can report the vulnerability via our Discord server: [https://discord.gg/76RY2Y82](https://discord.gg/76RY2Y82). Please join the server and reach out to one of the maintainers or administrators directly.

### What We Do Next

- Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours.
- We will then investigate and confirm the vulnerability. If confirmed, we will aim to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.
- We will keep you informed of the progress throughout the process and work with you to understand the impact and necessary steps for resolution.
- Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will provide a public update through the repository and, if applicable, credit the reporter (if they wish to be credited).

## Security Best Practices

We encourage all users of Mixeway Flow to:

- Keep your software up to date with the latest security patches.
- Regularly review the security settings of your deployments.
- Report any suspicious or unexpected behavior immediately.
